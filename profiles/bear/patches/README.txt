This folder is not directly used by the Bear make file. It is meant for those maintaining sites built using the Bear Starter Kit to easily keep track of patches that need to be re-applied on updates to core or contributed modules included with Bear.

These patches have been renamed for consistency in version control. The folder is a manually maintained repository of patches contained in the latest Bear make files.

As modules are updated to includes patches, the patches will be removed. As other modules require patches they will be added.

Important: Move this folder to your preferred location when creating your site with the Bear Starter Kit.
