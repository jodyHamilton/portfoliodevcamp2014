Bear Skin, a fully responsive Drupal starter theme packed with features and SASS goodies. 


Features
------------

Bear Skin is a sub theme of ZEN , which features an extensive documentation.  These might be good places to start if you have the desire to have a more in-depth knowledge about this release. The choice to use to ZEN was made when thinking about the best way to develop and extend on top of a very solid and well-supported base. This allows the Bear Skin to do some minimal skinning but more importantly, integrate well with the contributed modules included in the bear profile as well as providing an intuitive sass structure and various compass gems.


Known Issues
------------

If you want to rename the theme (folder and .info file) do not forget to change your variables in template.php and line 20 of html.tpl.php in your templates folder
